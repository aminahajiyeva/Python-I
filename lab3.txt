Using a text editor, type your solutions to the exercises in the lab
instructions (file ECOR1041_Lab3.pdf) in the indicated areas.

===========
Exercise 1:

(a) Write the Python statement that caused the variable degrees_f to
appear in the memory model

==> degrees_f = 70

(b) What is the name of the frame containing degrees_f?

==> Global frame.

(c) What does the arrow that points from degrees_f to 70 represent?

==> This arrow represents the object's memory address.

(d) Write the Python statement that caused the variable degrees_k to
appear in the memory model.

==> degrees_k = ((degrees_f = 32 * 5/9) + 273.15

(e) The arrow in degrees_k points to an object. What is the type and
value of this object?

==> degrees_k points to an object with the type float, and with the value 294.2611.

===========
Exercise 2:

Copy the four assignment statements from Python Tutor and paste them
between the two dashed lines.
--------------------------------
==> mpg = 32
==> LITRES_PER_GALLON = 4.54609
==> KMS_PER_MILE = 1.60934
==> fuel_consumption = 100/(mpg*KMS_PER_MILE/LITRES_PER_GALLON)
--------------------------------

(a) What is the name of the first variable that appears in the
memory model? What is the type and value of the object that it refers to?

==> The name of the first variable that appears in the memory model is mpg which is type int and it has the value of 32.

(b) What is the name of the second variable that appears in the
memory model? What is the type and value of the object that it refers to?

==> The name of the second variable that appears in the memory model is LITRES_PER_GALLON which is the type float and has the value of 4.54609.

(c) What is the name of the third variable that appears in the
memory model? What is the type and value of the object that it refers to?

==> The name of the third variable that appears in the memory model is KMS_PER_MILE which is type float and has a value of 1.60934.

(d) What is the name of the fourth variable that appears in the
memory model? What is the type and value of the object that it refers to?

==> The name of the fourth variable that appears in the memory model is fuel_consumption which is type float and has a value of........ 

===========
Exercise 3:

Copy the five assignment statements from Python Tutor and paste them
between the two dashed lines.
--------------------------------
==> principal = 1500
==> rate = 0.043
==> n = 4
==> time = 6
==> amount = principal*(pow(1+(rate/n),n*time))
--------------------------------.

===========
Exercise 4:

Write a short step-by-step explanation of how Python evaluates the
statement:

x *= x + x

when x refers to 5.

Python will first add the two x's together. It will then multiply the sum by the original value of x and lastly set x as this new value. The operation will be as follows: 

X *= 5+5
x *= 10
x = 50
